# Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs)

## Description

My program reads information about an existing Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), the Virtual Address Page table, and Physical Memory Direct Memory caching.
Based on storing this information, my program prompts the user a virtual address (in hex) and outputs the byte at that location.
My program prints out "Can not be determined" if the data is not available.
